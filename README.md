In our linear algebra courses, most of us come to fear or despise matrix multiplication.  Doing it by hand is a tedious procedure full of arithmetic operations very prone to errors. Luckily computers are there to handle the arithmetic so we can focus on the cool part of it. That being, what they mean and do. 

This repository contains code for generating animations of 2D and 3D linear transformations. You can go to the formal definition or look at the animations and notice how the origin does not change,  or the lines bend and do remain parallel. 

Here are some of the results, enjoy!!
